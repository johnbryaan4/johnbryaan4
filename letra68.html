    Shine bright like a diamond<br>
    Shine bright like a diamond<br><br>
    Find light in the beautiful sea<br>
    I choose to be happy<br>
    You and I, you and I<br>
    We're like diamonds in the sky<br>
    You're a shooting star I see<br>
    A vision of ecstasy<br>
    When you hold me, I'm alive<br>
    We're like diamonds in the sky<br><br>
    I knew that we'd become one right away<br>
    Oh, right away<br>
    At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays<br>
    I saw the life inside your eyes<br><br>
    So shine bright, tonight, you and I<br>
    We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky<br> <br>
    Eye to eye, so alive<br>
    We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky<br>
    Shine bright like a diamond (ooh, oh-oh)<br>
    Shine bright like a diamond (ooh, oh-oh)<br>
    Shining bright like a diamond<br>
    We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky<br><br>
    Shine bright like a diamond (ooh, oh-oh)<br>
    Shine bright like a diamond (ooh, oh-oh)<br>
    Shining bright like a diamond<br>
    We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky<br><br>
    Palms rise to the universe<br>
    As we moonshine and molly<br>
    Feel the warmth, we'll never die<br>
    We're like diamonds in the sky<br>
    You're a shooting star I see<br>
    A vision of ecstasy<br>
    When you hold me, I'm alive<br>
    We're like diamonds in the sky<br><br>
    At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays<br>
    I saw the life inside your eyes<br><br>
    So shine bright, tonight, you and I<br>
    We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky<br>
    Eye to eye, so alive<br>
    We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky<br><br>
    Shine bright like a diamond (ooh, oh-oh)<br>
    Shine bright like a diamond (ooh, oh-oh)<br>
    Shining bright like a diamond<br>
    We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky<br><br>
    Shine bright like a diamond (ooh, oh-oh)<br>
    Shine bright like a diamond (ooh, oh-oh)<br>
    Shining bright like a diamond<br>
    We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky<br><br>
    Shine bright like a diamond<br>
    Shine bright like a diamond<br>
    Shine bright like a diamond<br><br>
    So shine bright, tonight, you and I<br>
    We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky<br><br>
    Eye to eye, so alive<br>
    We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky<br>
    Shine bright like a diamond (ooh, oh-oh)<br>
    Shine bright like a diamond (ooh, oh-oh)<br>
    Shine bright like a diamond, whoa, oh yeah<br>
    Shine bright like a diamond (ooh, oh-oh)<br>
    Shine bright like a diamond (ooh, oh-oh)<br>
    Shine bright like a diamond<br>
    Shine bright like a diamond<br>
