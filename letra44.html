    California love!<br><br>
    California... knows how to party<br>
    California... knows how to party<br>
    In the citaaay of L.A.<br>
    In the citaaay of good ol' Watts<br>
    In the citaaay, the city of Compton<br><br>
    We keep it rockin! We keep it rockin!<br><br>
    Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west<br>
    A state that's untouchable like Elliot Ness<br>
    The track hits ya eardrum like a slug to ya chest<br>
    Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex<br>
    We in that sunshine state with a bomb ass hemp beat<br>
    The state where ya never find a dance floor empty<br>
    And pimps be on a mission for them greens<br>
    Lean mean money-makin-machines servin fiends<br>
    I been in the game for ten years makin rap tunes<br>
    Ever since honeys was wearin sassoon<br>
    Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me<br>
    Diamonds shinin lookin like I robbed Liberace<br>
    It's all good, from Diego to tha Bay<br>
    Your city is tha bomb if your city makin pay<br>
    Throw up a finger if ya feel the same way<br><br>
    Dre puttin it down for<br>
    Californ-i-a<br><br>
    Shake it shake it baby<br>
    Shake it shake it baby<br>
    Shake it shake it mama<br><br>
    Shake it Cali<br>
    Shake it shake it baby<br>
    Shake it shake it shake it shake it...<br><br>
    Out on bail fresh outta jail, California dreamin<br>
    Soon as I stepped on the scene, I'm hearin hoochies screamin<br><br>
    Fiendin for money and alcohol<br>
    The life of a west side playa where cowards die<br>
    Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die<br>
    In L.A. we wearin Chucks not Ballies (that's right)<br><br>
    Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do<br>
    Flossin but have caution we collide with other crews<br>
    Famous cause we program worldwide<br>
    Let'em recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans<br>
    Bumpin and grindin like a slow jam, it's west side<br>
    So you know the row won't bow down to no man<br>
    Say what you say<br>
    But give me that bomb beat from Dre<br>
    Let me serenade the streets of L.A.<br>
    From Oakland to Sacktown<br>
    The Bay Area and back down<br>
    Cali is where they put they mack down<br>
    Give me love!<br>
    Now make it shake...<br><br>
    Uh, yeah, uh, longbeach in tha house, uh yeah<br>
    Oaktown, Oakland definately in tha house hahaha<br>
    Frisko, Frisko<br>
    Hey, you know LA is up in this<br>
    Pasadena, where you at<br><br>
    Yeah, Inglewood, Inglewood always up to no good<br><br>
    even Hollywood tryin to get a piece baby<br>
    Sacramento, sacramento where ya at? yeah<br>
    Throw it up y'all, throw it up, Throw it up<br>
    Let's show these fools how we do this on that west side<br>
    Cause you and I know it's tha best side<br>
    Yeah, That's riight<br>
    West coast, west coast<br>
    Uh, California Love<br>
    California Love<br>
