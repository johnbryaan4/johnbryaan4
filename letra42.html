    Okay, go, go, go<br>

    I don't know what to do, I don't know what to<br><br>
    And I should slide for you<br>
    And that's my biggest problem, in denial 'bout you<br>
    Tonight, I'll go open up the night for you<br>
    Probably die for you, fuck around and lie for you<br>
    Probably cry for you<br><br>

    Please don't be the type to hate the things I do<br>
    And I'll ride for you, and I'll die for you<br>
    Homicide for you<br><br>
    And I should slide for you<br>
    And that's my biggest problem, in denial 'bout you<br>
    Tonight, I'll go open up the night for you<br>
