    Whoa, yeah<br><br>
    I've been waiting (I've been waiting)<br>
    I've been waiting up<br>
    'Cause I can't get enough, oh<br>
    I feel I'm fading (yeah)<br>
    When I fall apart<br>
    Your needle sews my heart, oh<br><br>
    Fuck me up and make me just go crazy<br>
    Addicted to the pain that you just made me love<br>
    I'm fiendin' for your touchin' on the daily<br>
    You're the only one that I want<br><br>
    Break my heart but don't tell me I'm not doin' fine<br>
    'Cause I'm doin' fine<br>
    Let me go, I'm spendin' time<br>
    Not doin' fine but I'm doin' fine<br><br>
    Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love<br>
    When you got everything that I want?<br>
    Why you actin' vain for my blood, vain for my blood<br>
    When you got everything that I want?<br>
    Why you actin'?<br><br>
    I've been dreamin' (uh)<br>
    Of your uniform<br>
    Your uniform of non-conformity<br>
    The tears, the tears<br>
    Tears aren't strong enough<br>
    The years aren't long enough, no<br><br>
    Fuck me up and make me just go crazy<br>
    Addicted to the pain that you just made me love (whoa, yeah)<br>
    I'm fiendin' for your touchin' on the daily<br>
    You're the only one that I want (yeah)<br><br>
    Break my heart but don't tell me I'm not doin' fine<br>
    'Cause I'm doin' fine<br>
    Let me go, I'm spendin' time<br>
    Not doin' fine but I'm doin' fine<br><br>
    Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love<br>
    When you got everything that I want?<br>
    Why you actin' vain for my blood, vain for my blood<br>
    When you got everything that I want?<br>
    Why you actin' vain?<br><br>
    It's hard to miss you<br>
    When you are always on the tip of my tongue, now<br>
    I feel like I'm looking for somethin'<br>
    Somethin' that'll never come<br><br>
    Call me when you're in the city again<br>
    My head just went oblivion<br>
    It's hard to miss you<br>
    When you are always on the tip of my tongue<br>
    (Always on the tip of my tongue)<br><br>
    And now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong<br>
    Now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong<br>
    When I've been waitin' (I've been waitin')<br>
    Long for you (long for you)<br><br>
    I wanna drink my wine, I wanna pass that by<br>
    I wanna make her cry, she wanna make me die<br>
    Apple pie, six cigarettes<br>
    And I'll catch the vibe that we can't forget<br><br>
    Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love<br>
    When you got everything that I want?<br>
    Why you actin' vain for my blood, vain for my blood<br>
    When you got everything that I want?<br>
    Why you actin' vain?<br><br>
    It's hard to miss you<br>
    When you are always on the tip of my tongue<br>
    I feel like I'm looking for somethin'<br>
    Somethin' that'll never come<br><br>
    I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)<br>
    Oh, for you (I'll be waiting) (for you)<br>
    And now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong (I'll be waiting)<br>
    And now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong (for you)<br>
