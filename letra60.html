    From the top<br>
    I'm not gonna worry about last night again, you just wanna see me fall again<br>
    That's alright I know you'll be back again for the last time<br>
    You know my pain and you know my life<br>
    You are the dark and you are the light<br>
    I steal the look when you're not with me<br>
    I wrote the book on feeling empty<br>
    Why did I ever take a chance on you?<br>
    I made you feel empty like the drugs that you do<br>
    You told me that you love me thats not easy to do<br>
    But girl, don't tell me that you love me if you're just gonna leave<br>
    Don't tell me that you love me it means nothing to me<br>
    No, no<br>
