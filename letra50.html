    I'm tired of being what you want me to be<br>
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface<br>
Don't know what you're expecting of me<br>
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes<br><br>
Every step that I take is another mistake to you<br>
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)<br><br>
I've become so numb<br>
I can't feel you there<br>
Become so tired<br>
So much more aware<br><br>
I'm becoming this<br>
All I want to do<br>
Is be more like me<br>
And be less like you<br><br>
Can't you see that you're smothering me<br>
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?<br>
'Cause everything that you thought I would be<br>
Has fallen apart right in front of you<br><br>
Every step that I take is another mistake to you<br>
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)<br>
And every second I waste is more than I can take<br><br>
I've become so numb<br>
I can't feel you there<br>
Become so tired<br>
So much more aware<br><br>
I'm becoming this<br>
All I want to do<br>
Is be more like me<br>
And be less like you<br><br>
And I know<br>
I may end up failing too<br>
But I know<br>
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you<br><br>
I've become so numb<br>
I can't feel you there<br>
Become so tired<br>
So much more aware<br><br>
I'm becoming this<br>
All I want to do<br>
Is be more like me<br>
And be less like you<br><br>
I've become so numb<br>
I can't feel you there<br>
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)<br>
I've become so numb<br>
I can't feel you there<br>
(I'm tired of being what you want me to be)<br>
