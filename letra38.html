    I do the same thing, I told you that I never would<br>
I told you I changed, even when I knew I never could<br>
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you<br>
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey<br><br>
I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still<br>
I realize the time that I wasted here<br>
I feel like you can't feel the way I feel<br>
I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here<br><br>
Oh-whoa (oh-whoa, oh-whoa)<br>
Oh-whoa (oh-whoa)<br>
Oh-whoa (oh-whoa)<br>
I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here<br><br>
I do the same thing, I told you that I never would<br>
I told you I changed, even when I knew I never could<br>
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you<br>
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey<br>
I do the same thing, I told you that I never would<br>
I told you I changed, even when I knew I never could<br>
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you<br>
I need you to stay, need you to stay, yeah<br><br>
When I'm away from you, I miss your touch (ooh)<br>
You're the reason I believe in love<br>
It's been difficult for me to trust (ooh)<br>
And I'm afraid that I'ma fuck it up<br>
Ain't no way that I can leave you stranded<br>
'Cause you ain't never left me empty-handed<br>
And you know that I know that I can't live without you<br>
So, baby, stay<br><br>
Oh-whoa (oh-whoa, oh-whoa)<br>
Oh-whoa (oh-whoa)<br>
Oh-whoa (oh-whoa)<br>
I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here<br><br>
I do the same thing, I told you that I never would<br>
I told you I changed, even when I knew I never could<br>
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you<br>
I need you to stay, need you to stay, yeah<br>
I do the same thing, I told you that I never would<br>
I told you I changed, even when I knew I never could<br>
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you<br>
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey<br><br>
Whoa-oh<br>
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey<br>
