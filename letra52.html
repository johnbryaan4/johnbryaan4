    The cycle repeated<br>
    As explosions broke in the sky<br>
    All that I needed<br>
    Was the one thing I couldn't find<br><br>
    And you were there at the turn<br>
    Waiting to let me know<br><br>
    We're building it up to break it back down<br>
    We're building it up to burn it down<br>
    We can't wait to burn it to the ground<br><br>
    The colors conflicted<br>
    As the flames climbed into the clouds<br>
    I wanted to fix this<br>
    But couldn't stop from tearing it down<br><br>
    And you were there at the turn<br>
    Caught in the burning glow<br>
    And I was there at the turn<br>
    Waiting to let you know<br><br>
    We're building it up to break it back down<br>
    We're building it up to burn it down<br>
    We can't wait to burn it to the ground<br><br>
    You told me yes, you held me high<br>
    And I believed when you told that lie<br>
    I played soldier, you played king<br>
    And struck me down when I kissed that ring<br><br>
    You lost that right to hold that crown<br>
    I built you up but you let me down<br>
    So when you fall, I'll take my turn<br>
    And fan the flames as your blazes burn<br><br>
    And you were there, at the turn<br>
    Waiting to let me know<br><br>
    We're building it up to break it back down<br>
    We're building it up to burn it down<br>
    We can't wait to burn it to the ground<br><br>
    When you fall, I'll take my turn<br>
    And fan the flames as your blazes burn<br>
    We can't wait to burn it to the ground<br>
    When you fall, I'll take my turn<br>
    And fan the flames as your blazes burn<br>
    We can't wait to burn it to the ground<br>
