    Fuck my life, can't save that girl<br>
    Don't tell me you could save that shit<br>
    All she want is payback for the way I always play that shit<br>
    You ain't gettin' nothin' that I'm sayin'<br>
    Don't tell me you is<br><br>
    Nothin' like them other motherfuckers<br>
    I can make you rich (I can make you rich)<br>
    I can make you this, baby, I can make you that<br>
    I could take you there, but baby, you won't make it back<br>
    Growing sick of this and I don't wanna make you sad<br>
    Do I make you scared? Baby, won't you take me back?<br><br>
