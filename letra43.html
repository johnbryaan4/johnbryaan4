    I shoulda seen you was trouble right from the start<br>
Taught me so many lessons<br>
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions<br>
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps<br>
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now<br>
The arguments are gettin' loud, I wanna stay<br>
But I can't help from walkin' out, let's throw it away<br>
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see<br>
I never planned to be a man it just wasn't me<br>
But now I'm searchin' for commitment, in other arms<br>
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed<br>
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin'<br>
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions<br>
Like, where can I be? You're killin' me with your jealousy<br>
Now my ambition's to be free<br>
I can't breathe, 'cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap<br>
I hear you callin' me to come back, I'm a sucka for love<br><br>
What you won't do, do for love (that's right)<br>
You tried everything, but you don't give up<br><br>
What you won't do, do for love (sucka for love)<br>
You tried everything, but you don't give up (no, baby)<br><br>
Just when I thought I broke away and I'm feelin' happy<br>
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy<br>
Don't wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I'm back<br>
To makin promises to you, tryna keep it true<br>
What if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me on and on<br>
Tryin' to be strong and in the process, keep you goin'<br>
I'm bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin' close<br>
To packin' up and leavin' notes, and gettin' ghost (ooh-oh)<br>
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go<br>
To clear my head I'm feelin low, losin' control<br>
My heart is sayin' leave, oh what a tangled web we weave<br>
When we conspire to conceive, and now<br>
You gettin' calls at the house, guess you cheatin'<br>
That's all I need to hear 'cause I'm leavin', I'm out the do'<br>
Never no more will you see me, this is the end<br>
Cause now I know you've been cheatin, I'm a sucka for love<br><br>
What you won't do, do for love (sucka for love)<br>
You tried everything, but you don't give up (don't give up)<br>
What you won't do, do for love (oh yeah, sucka for love)<br>
You tried everything, but you don't give up (no, baby)<br><br>
Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay<br>
As you sit and pray, hopin' the beatings'll go away<br>
It wasn't always a hit and run relationship<br>
It use to be love, happiness and companionship<br>
Remember when I treated you good<br>
I moved you up to hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood<br>
Me and you a happy home, when it was on<br>
I had a love to call my own (own)<br>
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes<br>
Preoccupied with gettin' tossed, no need to lie<br>
You had a man and I knew it, you told me<br>
Don't worry 'bout it we can do it now I'm under pressure (yeah)<br>
Make a decision cause I'm waitin', when I'm alone<br>
I'm on the phone havin' secret conversations, huh<br>
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness<br>
But I need your faith in me, I'm a sucka for love<br><br>
What you won't do, do for love (what you won't do for love)<br>
You tried everything, but you don't give up (every little thing)<br>
What you won't do, do for love (you don won't do for love, my pretty baby)<br>
You tried everything, but you don't give up (no)<br>
What you won't do, do for love (I'm sucka for love)<br>
You tried everything, but you don't give up (oh-ooh, oh)<br>
What you won't do, do for love (sucka for love)<br>
You tried everything (sucka for love), but you don't give up (oh)<br>
What you won't do, do for love (do)<br>
You tried everything (every little thing, babe), but you don't give up (no)<br>
What you won't do, do for love<br>
You tried everything, but you don't give up (do for love)<br><br>
Yeah baby, yeah<br>
(Do for love)<br>
