    Crawling in my skin<br>
These wounds, they will not heal<br>
Fear is how I fall<br>
Confusing what is real<br><br>
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface<br>
Consuming, confusing<br>
This lack of self control I fear is never ending<br>
Controlling<br>
I can't seem<br><br>
To find myself again<br>
My walls are closing in<br>
(Without a sense of confidence, I'm convinced)<br>
(That there's just too much pressure to take)<br>
I've felt this way before<br>
So insecure<br><br>
Crawling in my skin<br>
These wounds, they will not heal<br>
Fear is how I fall<br>
Confusing what is real<br><br>
Discomfort, endlessly has pulled itself upon me<br>
Distracting, reacting<br>
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection<br>
It's haunting<br>
How I can't seem<br><br>
To find myself again<br>
My walls are closing in<br>
(Without a sense of confidence, I'm convinced)<br>
(That there's just too much pressure to take)<br>
I've felt this way before<br>
So insecure<br><br>
Crawling in my skin<br>
These wounds, they will not heal<br>
Fear is how I fall<br>
Confusing what is real<br><br>
Crawling in my skin<br>
These wounds, they will not heal<br>
Fear is how I fall<br>
Confusing, confusing what is real<br><br>
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface<br>
Consuming (confusing what is real)<br>
This lack of self control I fear is never ending<br>
Controlling (confusing what is real)<br>
