Change, shit
I guess change is good for any of us<br>
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggas to get up out the hood<br>
Shit, I'm wit cha, I ain't mad at cha<br>
Got nuttin but love for ya, do your thing boy<br><br>
Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while<br>
I'ma send this one out for y'all, kna' mean?<br>
'Cause I ain't mad at cha<br>
Heard y'all tearin' up shit out there, kickin' up dust<br>
Givin' a motherfucker,<br>
Yeah, niggas, mad at cha<br>
'Cause I ain't mad at cha<br><br>
Now we was once two niggas of the same kind<br>
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line<br>
You was just a little smaller but you still rolled<br>
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll<br>
Member when you had a jheri curl didn't quite learn<br>
On the block, witcha glock, trippin off sherm<br>
Collect calls to the till, sayin' how ya changed<br>
Oh you a Muslim now, no more dope game<br>
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail<br>
Wanna go to the Mosque, don't wanna chase tail<br>
I seems I lost my little homie he's a changed man<br>
Hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan<br>
When I talk about money all you see is the struggle<br>
When I tell you I'm livin' large you tell me it's trouble<br>
Congratulation on the weddin', I hope your wife know<br>
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'<br>
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember<br>
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her<br>
And I can see us after school, we'd bomb!<br>
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on<br>
Now the whole shit's changed, and we don't even kick it<br>
Got a big money scheme, and you ain't even with it<br>
Hmm, knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker bad<br>
Go toe to toe when it's time for roll you got a brother's back<br>
And I can't even trip, 'cause I'm just laughin' at cha<br>
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go head<br>
'Cause I ain't mad at cha<br>
(Hmm) (I ain't mad at cha)<br><br>
I ain't, mad, at cha (I ain't mad at cha)<br>
I ain't, mad, at cha<br><br>
We used to be like distant cousins, fightin', playin' dozens<br>
Whole neighborhood buzzin', knowin', that we wasn't<br>
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs<br>
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared<br>
Besides bumpin' n grindin' wasn't nothin' on our mind<br>
In time we learned to live a life of crime<br>
Rewind us back, to a time was much too young to know<br>
I caught a felony lovin the way the guns blow<br>
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait<br>
Don't give nobody no coochie while I be locked up state<br>
I kiss my Mama goodbye, and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes<br>
Said I'll return but I gotta fight the fate's arrived<br>
Don't shed a tear, 'cause Mama I ain't happy here<br>
I'm through trial, no more smiles, for a couple years<br>
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs<br>
In my cell, thinkin, "Hell, I know one day I'll be back"<br>
As soon as I touch down<br>
I told my girl I'll be there, so prepare, to get fucked down<br>
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha<br>
'Cause youse a down ass bitch, and I ain't mad at cha<br><br>
I ain't, mad, at cha (I ain't mad at cha)<br>
I ain't, mad, at cha (A true down ass bitch, afund I ain't mad at cha)<br><br>
Well guess who's movin up, this nigga's ballin' now<br>
Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down<br>
He went from nothin' to lots, ten carots to rock<br>
Went from a nobody nigga to the big, man on the block<br>
He's Mister local celebrity, addicted to move a key<br>
Most hated by enemy, escape in the luxury<br>
See, first you was our nigga but you made it, so the choice is made<br>
Now we gotta slay you why you faded, in the younger days<br>
So full of pain while the weapons blaze<br>
Gettin' so high off that bomb hopin' we make it, to the better days<br>
'Cause crime pays, and in time,<br>
You'll find a rhyme'll blaze you'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days<br>
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot<br>
That I keep a glock beside my head, when will it stop?<br>
Til God return me to my essence<br>
'Cause even as a adolescents, I refuse to be a convalescent<br>
So many questions, and they ask me if I'm still down<br>
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?<br>
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at cha<br>
You niggas just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha<br><br>
I ain't, mad at cha (and I ain't mad at cha)<br>
I ain't mad (hell nah I ain't mad at cha) at cha<br>
I ain't, mad at cha (and I ain't mad at cha)<br>
I ain't, mad at cha (I ain't mad at cha)<br>
I ain't, mad at cha, no<br>
I ain't mad at cha<br>
