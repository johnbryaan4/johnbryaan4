    Ooh, yeah (Ooh)<br>
    (Come on, come on)<br><br>
    I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself<br>
    Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?<br>
    I'm tired of bein' poor and, even worse, I'm black<br>
    My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch<br>
    Cops give a damn about a negro<br>
    Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero<br>
    Give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares?<br>
    One less hungry mouth on the welfare<br>
    First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers<br>
    Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other<br>
    "It's time to fight back, " that's what Huey said<br>
    Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead<br>
    I got love for my brother<br>
    But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other<br>
    We gotta start makin' changes<br>
    Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers<br>
    And that's how it's supposed to be<br>
    How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me? Uh<br>
    I'd love to go back to when we played as kids<br>
    But things change, and that's the way it is<br><br>
    That's just the way it is (Changes)<br>
    Things'll never be the same<br>
    That's just the way it is (That's the way it is, what?)<br>
    Aww, yeah-yeah (Hear me)<br>
    (Oh my, oh my, come on, come on)<br>
    That's just the way it is (That's just the way it is, the way it is)<br>
    Things'll never be the same<br>
    (Never be the same, yeah, yeah, yeah, aww, yeah)<br>
    That's just the way it is (Way it is)<br>
    Aww, yeah (Come on, come on)<br><br>
    I see no changes, all I see is racist faces<br>
    Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races<br>
    We under, I wonder what it takes to make this<br>
    One better place, let's erase the wasted<br>
    Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right<br>
    'Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight<br>
    And the only time we chill is when we kill each other (Kill each other)<br>
    It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other<br>
    And although it seems heaven-sent<br>
    We ain't ready to see a black president, uh (Oh-ooh)<br>
    It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact<br>
    The penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks<br>
    But some things will never change (Never Change)<br>
    Try to show another way, but you stayin' in the dope game (Ooh)<br>
    Now tell me, what's a mother to do?<br>
    Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you (Yeah)<br>
    You gotta operate the easy way<br>
    "I made a G today, " but you made it in a sleazy way<br>
    Sellin' crack to the kids (Oh-oh), "I gotta get paid" (Oh)<br>
    Well hey, well that's the way it is<br><br>
    That's just the way it is (Changes)<br>
    Things'll never be the same<br>
    That's just the way it is (That's the way it is, what?)<br>
    Aww, yeah (Hear me)<br>
    (Oh my, oh my, come on, come on)<br>
    That's just the way it is (That's just the way it is, the way it is)<br>
    Things'll never be the same<br>
    (Never be the same, yeah, yeah, yeah, aww, yeah)<br>
    That's just the way it is (Way it is)<br>
    Aww, yeah (Aww, yeah, aww, yeah)<br><br>
    We gotta make a change<br>
    It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes<br>
    Let's change the way we eat<br>
    Let's change the way we live<br>
    And let's change the way we treat each other<br>
    You see, the old way wasn't workin'<br>
    So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive<br><br>
    And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace?<br>
    It's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East (Ooh, yeah)<br>
    Instead of war on poverty<br>
    They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me<br>
    And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do<br>
    But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you (Ooh)<br>
    Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up<br>
    Crack you up and pimp-smack you up<br>
    You gotta learn to hold your own<br>
    They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone<br>
    But tell the cops they can't touch this<br>
    I don't trust this, when they try to rush, I bust this<br>
    That's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool<br>
    My mama didn't raise no fool (Oh)<br>
    And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped<br>
    And I never get to lay back<br>
    'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback<br>
    Some buck that I roughed up way back<br>
    Comin' back after all these years<br>
    "Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat, " that's the way it is, uh<br><br>
    That's just the way it is (Just the way it is, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
    Things'll never be the same (Yeah)<br>
    That's just the way it is (The way it is)<br>
    Aww, yeah (Some things will never change, oh my)<br>
    (I'm tryna make a change)<br>
    (You're my brother, you're my sister, yeah)<br>
    That's just the way it is (The way it is, the way it is)<br>
    Things'll never be the same (You're my brother, you're my sister)<br>
    That's just the way it is, aww, yeah<br>
    Some things will never change<br>
