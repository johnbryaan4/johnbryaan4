 We fight every day and night<br>
You want me to make the time<br>
You always get mad and say what you coulda had<br>
And that you want me to make it right, uh<br>
I couldn't do that to save my life<br>
You always tell me you ain't surprised<br>
You say, "This the last time"<br>
I guess that you were right<br>
'Cause I'ma do one with you tonight<br><br>
And now I'm so sick of these love songs<br>
So sad and slow<br>
And I'm so sick of wishin'<br>
I had you on my own<br>
And, oh, baby, I've been fucked up<br>
Ever since you been gone<br>
I can't bring myself to even pick up my phone<br>
I need you the most<br>
I need you the most<br>
I need you the most<br>
I need you the most<br>
I need you the most<br><br>
I ain't gon' lie, oh baby, I've been fucked up<br>
I said I was sorry for all of the times I fucked up<br>
Fuck love, got me thinkin' while I pour my cup up<br>
Tonight is in memory of you, I'm gettin' fucked up<br>
Oh, just one more chance to make it right<br>
Promise I got you, so tell me, what's up?<br>
I don't think that I can keep goin' this way<br>
I can't take it<br><br>
Now I'm so sick of these love songs<br>
So sad and slow<br>
And I'm so sick of wishin'<br>
I had you on my own<br>
And, oh, baby, I've been fucked up<br>
Ever since you been gone<br>
I can't bring myself to even pick up my phone<br>
I need you the most<br>
I need you the most<br>
I need you the most<br>
I need you the most<br>
I need you the most<br>
