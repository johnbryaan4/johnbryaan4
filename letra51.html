    I remembered black skies<br>
    The lightning all around me<br>
    I remembered each flash<br>
    As time began to blur<br>
    Like a startling sign<br>
    That fate had finally found me<br>
    And your voice was all I heard<br>
    That I get what I deserve<br><br>
    So give me reason<br>
    To prove me wrong<br>
    To wash this memory clean<br>
    Let the floods cross<br>
    The distance in your eyes<br>
    Give me reason<br>
    To fill this hole<br>
    Connect this space between<br>
    Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies<br>
    Across this new divide<br><br>
    There was nothing in sight<br>
    But memories left abandoned<br>
    There was nowhere to hide<br>
    The ashes fell like snow<br>
    And the ground caved in<br>
    Between where we were standing<br>
    And your voice was all I heard<br>
    That I get what I deserve<br><br>
    So give me reason<br>
    To prove me wrong<br>
    To wash this memory clean<br>
    Let the floods cross<br>
    The distance in your eyes<br>
    Across this new divide<br><br>
    In every loss, in every lie<br>
    In every truth that you'd deny<br>
    And each regret, and each goodbye<br>
    Was a mistake too great to hide<br>
    And your voice was all I heard<br>
    That I get what I deserve<br>
    So give me reason<br>
    To prove me wrong<br>
    To wash this memory clean<br>
    Let the floods cross<br>
    The distance in your eyes<br><br>
    Give me reason<br>
    To fill this hole<br>
    Connect this space between<br>
    Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies<br>
    Across this new divide<br>
    Across this new divide<br>
    Across this new divide<br>
