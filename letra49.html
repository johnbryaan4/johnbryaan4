    I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard<br>
    Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact<br>
    That everyone can see these scars<br>
    I am what I want you to want, what I want you to feel<br>
    But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you<br>
    To just believe this is real<br><br>
    So I, let go watching you turn your back like you always do<br>
    Face away and pretend that I'm not<br>
    But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got<br><br>
    I can't feel the way I did before<br>
    Don't turn your back on me<br>
    I won't be ignored<br>
    Time won't heal this damage anymore<br>
    Don't turn your back on me<br>
    I won't be ignored<br><br>
    I am, a little bit insecure, a little unconfident<br>
    'Cause you don't understand I do what I can<br>
    But sometimes I don't make sense<br>
    I am, what you never want to say<br>
    But I've never had a doubt<br>
    It's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you<br>
    For once just to hear me out<br><br>
    So I, let go watching you turn your back like you always do<br>
    Face away and pretend that I'm not<br>
    But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got<br><br>
    I can't feel the way I did before<br>
    Don't turn your back on me<br>
    I won't be ignored<br>
    Time won't heal this damage anymore<br>
    Don't turn your back on me<br>
    I won't be ignored<br><br>
    No, hear me out now<br>
    You're gonna listen to me, like it or not<br>
    Right now, hear me out now<br>
    You're gonna listen to me, like it or not<br>
    Right now<br><br>
    I can't feel the way I did before<br>
    Don't turn your back on me<br>
    I won't be ignored<br><br>
    I can't feel the way I did before<br>
    Don't turn your back on me<br>
    I won't be ignored<br>
    Time won't heal this damage anymore<br>
    Don't turn your back on me<br>
    I won't be ignored<br><br>
    I can't feel...<br>
    Don't turn your back on me<br>
    I won't be ignored<br>
    Time won't heal...<br>
    Don't turn your back on me<br>
    I won't be ignored<br>
