Brenda's (Brenda's)<br>
Got a (got a)<br>
Baby<br>
Say that one more time Brenda<br>
Brenda's<br>
Got a (baby)<br>
Baby<br><br>
I hear Brenda's got a baby<br>
But Brenda's barely got a brain<br>
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name<br>
(That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family)<br>
Well, let me show ya how it affects the whole community<br>
Now Brenda really never knew her moms and her dad was a<br>
Junky, puttin' death to his arms, it's sad 'cause I bet<br>
Brenda doesn't even know<br>
Just 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow (you can't grow)<br>
But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation<br>
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation<br>
Brenda got herself a boyfriend<br>
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end<br>
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family<br>
Who didn't really care to see, or give a damn if she<br>
Went out and had a church of kids<br>
As long as when the check came they got first dibs<br>
Now Brenda's belly is gettin' bigger<br>
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure<br>
She's 12 years old and she's having a baby<br>
In love with the molester, who's sexing her crazy<br>
And yet and also she thinks that he'll be with her forever<br>
And dreams of a world with the two of them are together<br>
Whatever, he left her and she had the baby solo<br>
She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know so<br>
She didn't know, what to throw away and what to keep<br>
She wrapped the baby up and threw him in the trash heep<br>
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries<br>
She didn't realize<br>
How much the the little baby had her eyes<br>
Now the baby's in the trash heep balling<br>
Momma can't help her, but it hurts to hear her calling<br>
Brenda wants to run away<br>
Momma say, "you makin' me lose pay<br>
And social workers here everyday"<br>
Now Brenda's gotta make her own way<br>
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay<br>
No money, no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job<br>
She tried to sell crack, but end up getting robbed<br>
So now what's next, there ain't nothing left to sell<br>
So she sees sex as a way of leaving hell<br>
It's paying the rent, so she really can't complain<br>
Prostitute, found slain, and Brenda's her name, she's got a baby<br><br>
Baby<br><br>
She's had a baby<br>
(Don't you know she's got a) (yes, she had)<br>
(Don't you know she's got a) (yes, she)<br>
(Don't you know she's got a baby) (she's had a baby)<br><br>
I know, know know, know, know, know, know, know<br>
(Don't you know she's got a) (know, know, know, know)<br>
(Don't you know she's got a) (I know, I know)<br>
(Don't you know she's got a baby) (so all alone with a baby)<br>
