    Up out of there<br>
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party<br>
    Eh, light that up, Snoop! Why you actin' like that?<br>
    Ahh shit, you done fucked up now<br>
    (Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)<br>
    You done put two of America's most wanted<br>
    In the same motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time?<br>
    (Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)<br>
    Y'all niggas about to feel this (ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)<br>
    Break out the champagne glasses and the motherfuckin' condoms<br>
    Have one on us a'ight (ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)<br>
    A toast to the gangsters<br><br>
    Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture<br>
    Bomb the hoochies with precision, my intention's to get richer<br>
    With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg my fuckin' homie<br>
    You'se a cold-ass nigga on them hogs<br><br>
    Sure 'nough, I keep my hand on my gun<br>
    Cause they got me on the run<br>
    Now I'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome<br>
    "Free 2Pac" is all that's on a nigga's mind<br>
    But at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine<br>
    So I'mma get smart and get defensive and shit<br>
    And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit<br><br>
    So now they got us laced<br>
    Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases<br>
    Bitches get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down<br>
    Me and Snoop about to clown<br>
    I'm losing my religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons<br>
    You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'<br>
    Niggas be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage<br>
    I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish<br><br>
    I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerina<br>
    I've got a house out in the hills right next to Chino<br>
    And I think I've got a black Bimmer<br>
    But my dream is to own a fly casino<br>
    Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal<br>
    And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal<br>
    It feels good to you, baby-bubba<br>
    You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker<br><br>
    Now follow as we ride!<br>
    Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the Westside<br>
    And I can make you famous<br>
    Niggas been dyin' for years, so how could they blame us?<br>
    I live in fear of a felony<br>
    I never stop bailin' these motherfuckin' G's<br>
    If you got it, better flaunt it<br>
    Another warrant, two of Amerikaz most wanted (ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)<br><br>
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party<br>
    (Nothin' but a gangsta party)<br>
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party<br>
    (Nothin' but a gangsta party<br>
    It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)<br>
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party<br>
    (Nothin' but a gangsta party<br>
    It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)<br>
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party<br><br>
    Now give me fifty feet<br>
    Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets<br>
    And keep whatever's left of me<br>
    Jealousy is misery, suffering is greed<br>
    Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me<br>
    I bust and flee, these niggas must be crazy, what?<br>
    There ain't no mercy, motherfuckers can't fade the thugs<br>
    You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear<br>
    Bow down in the presence of a boss player<br><br>
    It's like Cuzz, Blood, gang-bangin'<br>
    Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'<br>
    You gotta have papers in this world<br>
    You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl<br>
    You doin' your job every day<br>
    And then you work so hard til your hair turns gray<br>
    Let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is<br>
    You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kids<br><br>
    They tell me not to roll with my Glock<br>
    So now I gotta throw away<br>
    Floatin' in the black Benz (bitch), tryin' to do a show a day<br>
    They wonder how I live with five shots<br>
    Niggas is hard to kill on my block!<br>
    Schemes for currency and dough-related<br>
    Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it<br>
    No answers to questions, I'm trying to get up on it<br>
    My nigga Dogg wit' me, eternally the most wanted<br><br>
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party<br>
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party<br>
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party<br>
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party<br>
    (Nothin' but a gangsta party<br>
    It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)<br>
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party<br>
    (Nothin' but a gangsta party<br>
    It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)<br>
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party<br>
    (Nothin' but a gangsta party<br>
    It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)<br>
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party<br>
    (Nothin' but a gangsta party<br>
    It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)<br>
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party (biatch)<br><br>
    Where you at? Where you at?<br>
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party<br>
    Yeah, Death Row<br>
