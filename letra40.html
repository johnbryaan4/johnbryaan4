    Said I wouldn't drink, but I did the same day<br>
    Shit, I lied to your face like I always do<br>
    Said I was gon' change, both know that I can't<br>
    Shit, I'd rather take the blame like I always do<br>
    I been the same ever since the first day<br>
    Now you actin' surprised, but bitch, you always knew<br>
    Maybe it's time for me to find somebody else<br>
    Like I always do<br><br>
    I know you can't believe me 'cause I never tell the truth but, oh<br>
    I wish that you could just see that it's only to protect you, now<br>
    How many times can somebody want the same pain? (Pain, pain)<br>
    When the pressure put on me, then I change things<br>
    And every time that I run, I know you gon' chase<br>
    We always end up right back in the same place<br><br>
    You-u-u-u-u, wastin' all my time with you-u-u-u-u<br>
    Wishin' I was someone new-ew-ew-ew-ew<br>
    Stuck up in my ways and you say that you hate it, but<br>
    You always knew<br><br>
    Said I wouldn't drink, but I did the same day<br>
    Shit, I lied to your face like I always do<br>
    Said I was gon' change, both know that I can't<br>
    Shit, I'd rather take the blame like I always do<br>
    I been the same ever since the first day<br>
    Now you actin' surprised, but bitch, you always knew<br>
    Maybe it's time for me to find somebody else<br>
    Like I always do<br><br>
    Do, do, do, do, do, like I always do<br>
    Do, do, do, do, do, like I always do<br><br>
    I'm sorry, I can't be the me you wanted<br>
    I'm about to fall, then you're all in<br>
    I'm not the one to solve your problems (no, no)<br>
    'Cause I'm fucked up too-oo-oo-oo-oo<br><br>
    Wastin' all my time with you-u-u-u-u<br>
    Wishin' I was someone new-ew-ew-ew-ew<br>
    Stuck up in my ways and you say that you hate it, but<br>
    You always knew<br><br>
    Said I wouldn't drink, but I did the same day<br>
    Shit, I lied to your face like I always do<br>
    Said I was gon' change, both know that I can't<br>
    Shit, I'd rather take the blame like I always do<br>
    I've been the same ever since the first day<br>
    Now you actin' surprised, but bitch, you always knew<br>
    Maybe it's time for me to find somebody else<br>
    Like I always do<br><br>
    Do, do, do, do, do, like I always do<br>
    Do, do, do, do, do, like I always do<br>
