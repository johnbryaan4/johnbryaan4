    Wait right here<br>
    I'll be back in the morning<br>
    I know that I'm not that important to you<br>
    But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous<br>
    So much more than perfect<br>
    Right now I know that I'm not really worth it<br>
    If you give me time, I could work on it<br>
    Give me some time while I work on it<br><br>
    Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you<br>
    The Earth's in rotation, you're waiting for me<br>
    Look at my face when I fuck on your waist<br>
    'Cause we only have one conversation a week<br>
    That's why your friends always hatin' on me<br>
    Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself<br>
    Matter of fact, I ain't ever asked no one for help<br>
    And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings<br><br>
    None of my exes is over Lil Peep<br>
    Nobody flexin' as much as I be<br>
    That's why she text me and tell me she love me<br>
    She know that someday I'll be over the sea<br>
    Makin' my money and smokin' my weed<br>
    I think it's funny, she open up to me, get comfortable with me<br>
    Once I got it comin', I love her, she love me<br><br>
    I know that I'm nothing like someone the family want me to be<br>
    If I find a way, would you walk it with me?<br>
    Look at my face while you talkin' to me<br>
    'Cause we only have one conversation a week<br>
    Can I get one conversation at least?<br>
    Shout out to everyone makin' my beats, you helpin' me preach<br>
    This music's the only thing keeping<br>
    The peace when I'm fallin' to pieces<br><br>
    Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason<br>
    A reason to shine, a reason like mine and I'm fallin' to pieces<br>
    Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason<br>
