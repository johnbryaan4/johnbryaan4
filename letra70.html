    Na-na-na, come on<br>
    Na-na-na, come on<br>
    Na-na-na-na-na, come on<br>
    Na-na-na, come on, come on, come on<br><br>
    Na-na-na-na, come on<br>
    Na-na-na, come on<br>
    Na-na-na-na-na, come on<br>
    Na-na-na, come on, come on, come on<br>
    Na-na-na-na<br><br>
    Feels so good being bad (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)<br>
    There's no way I'm turning back (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)<br>
    Now the pain is for pleasure<br>
    'Cause nothing can measure (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)<br><br>
    Love is great, love is fine (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)<br>
    Out the box, outta line (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)<br>
    The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)<br><br>
    'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it<br>
    Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it<br>
    Sticks and stones may break my bones<br>
    But chains and whips excite me<br><br>
    'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it<br>
    Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it<br>
    Sticks and stones may break my bones<br>
    But chains and whips excite me<br>
    Na-na-na, come on, come on, come on<br>
    I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on<br>
    I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on<br>
    I like it, like it come on, come on, come on<br>
    I like it, like it<br><br>
    Love is great, love is fine (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)<br>
    Out the box, outta line (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)<br>
    The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)<br><br>
    'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it<br>
    Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it<br>
    Sticks and stones may break my bones<br>
    But chains and whips excite me<br><br>
    Na-na-na, come on, come on, come on<br>
    I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on<br>
    I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on<br>
    I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on<br>
    I like it, like it<br><br>
    S, S, S and M, M, M<br>
    S, S, S and M, M, M<br><br>
    Oh, I love the feeling you bring to me, oh, you turn me on<br>
    It's exactly what I've been yearning for, give it to me strong<br>
    And meet me in my boudoir<br>
    Make my body say ah, ah, ah, I like it (like it)<br><br>
    'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it<br>
    Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it<br>
    Sticks and stones may break my bones<br>
    But chains and whips excite me<br><br>
    'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it<br>
    Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it<br>
    Sticks and stones may break my bones<br>
    But chains and whips excite me<br><br>
    Na-na-na, come on, come on, come on<br>
    I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on<br>
    I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on<br>
    I like it, like it, come on, come on, come on<br>
    I like it, like it<br><br>
    S, S, S and M, M, M<br>
    S, S, S and M, M, M<br>
    S, S, S and M, M, M<br>
    S, S, S and M, M, M<br>
