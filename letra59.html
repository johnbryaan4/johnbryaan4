    Baby, how you doing?<br>
    I know you're not doing the best<br>
    But I'm here, I'll always be here<br>
    Tell me if you need me<br>
    And call me if you feelin' alone<br>
    'Cause I'm here, I'm always right here<br>
    Tell me that I'm dumb<br>
    I love to get numb<br>
    I know that I'm young, but I'm still right here<br>
    I don't give a fuck<br>
    I love who I love<br>
    And girl, you're that one, so I'll wait right here (GothBoiClique)<br><br>

    Baby, I'm leaving<br>
    I'm not taking anything but you<br>
    Pictures of us escaping<br>
    In the background of the photo, I see you<br>
    I remember the time<br>
    I remember hearts sewn together with twine<br>
    Just remember that I am still right here<br>
    And if you doubt me, that's just fine<br>
    And when it comes clear<br>
    I will be waiting right here<br>
    Just tell me if you need me<br>
    And I will meet you right there<br>
