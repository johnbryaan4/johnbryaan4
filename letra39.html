You cut out a piece of me, and now I bleed internally<br>
Left here without you (no, no, no), without you (ooh)<br>
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like<br>
Without you (no, no, no), without you (no, no)<br><br>
I can't believe that you wouldn't believe me<br>
Fuck all of your reasons<br>
I lost my shit, you know I didn't mean it<br>
Now I see it, you run and repeat it<br>
And I can't take it back, so in the past is where we'll leave it, huh<br><br>
So there you go, oh<br>
Can't make a wife out of a ho, oh<br>
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry<br>
But I'm scared to be alone<br><br>
You cut out a piece of me, and now I bleed internally<br>
Left here without you (no, no, no), without you (ooh)<br>
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like<br>
Without you (no, no, no), without you (no, no)<br><br>
Oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh-oh, whoa-oh<br>
Oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh-oh, whoa-oh<br>
Without you, without you, ooh<br>
Oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh-oh, whoa-oh<br>
Oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh-oh, whoa-oh<br>
Without you, without you<br><br>    
It's gon' be hard here on my own<br>
And even harder to let you go<br>
I really wish that we could've got this right<br><br>
So here I go, oh<br>
Can't make a wife out of a ho, oh<br>
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry<br>
But I'm scared to be alone<br><br>
You cut out a piece of me, and now I bleed internally<br>
Left here without you (no, no, no), without you (ooh)<br>
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like<br>
Without you (no, no, no), without you (no, no)<br><br>
Oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh-oh, whoa-oh<br>
Oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh-oh, whoa-oh<br>
Without you, without you (no, no, no)<br>
